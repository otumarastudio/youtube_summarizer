# YouTube Video Summarizer

This project is a Python-based tool that automatically summarizes YouTube videos using the power of AI. 
It extracts the video content, splits it into chunks, and generates concise summaries for each chunk. 
The tool then combines these summaries into a comprehensive report, providing users with quick insights into the video's key points and takeaways. 
The summaries are saved as Markdown files for easy readability and sharing.
